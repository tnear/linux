# Create a long running process:
$ sleep 1000

$ Ctrl+Z  # Suspend sleep job

$ Use 'jobs' to show suspended state
[1]  + suspended  sleep 1000

# Place sleep job in background (state changes to 'continued':
$ bg
[1]  + continued  sleep 1000

# Show that sleep process is running again:
$ jobs
[1]  + running    sleep 1000

# Place sleep job in foreground:
$ fg
[1]  + running    sleep 1000
