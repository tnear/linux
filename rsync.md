# rsync

`rsync` - a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool

## Common flags

```
-a, --archive = recursive copy, preserving all metadata (recommended)
-v, --verbose = by default, sync is silent
-P            = partial + progress. Shows progress while preserving partially transferred files (recommended)
```

## Copy all files from dir/ to newDir/
```
# (rsync will create newDir if it doesn't exist)
$ rsync -av dir newDir/
sending incremental file list

## Remote computer with partial and progress
Using `rsync` for remote transfers because the `-P` flag will resume file transfer after recovering from a disconnect.
```
$ rsync -P a.html tnear@100.101.102.103:/home/user
a.html
