# time

`time` â€” time a simple command

## Basic usage
Prefix a command to run with `time`:
```bash
$ time ping -c3 example.com
real    2.08s
user    0.00s
sys     0.01s
cpu     0%
```

## Measure compilation
```bash
$ time g++ main.cc
g++ main.cc  0.16s user, 0.05s system, 89% cpu, 0.227 total
```

- 0.16s user: the time spent in user mode (outside of kernel)
- 0.5s system: time spent in kernel
- 89% cpu: CPU utilization. This number will be low for I/O bound tasks
- 0.227 total: user time + system time

## Time multiple commands defined in file
`$ time (source fileWithCmds.txt) > /dev/null`

## Time is a reserved shell keyword
The shell interprets it before it can go to an external command:
```bash
$ type time
time is a reserved word
```

## `/bin/time`
`/bin/time` is another timing command which can display detailed diagnostics such as memory usage and page faults.

Installation: `$ sudo apt install time`

### Python printing
Use `-v` for verbose output.
```bash
$ /bin/time -v python -c 'print("hello world")'
hello world
        Command being timed: "python -c print("hello world")"
