# NVMe

Non-Volatile Memory is a specification for accessing a computer's non-volatile storage attached via a PCI Express bus.

An SSD runs a *command set* over a *transport*. For example, AHCI (the command set) runs over SATA. SCSI runs over SAS. NVMe runs over PCIe (local) or RoCE (remote).

NVMe is faster and more parallel than SAS.
