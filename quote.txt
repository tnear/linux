QUOTE

'Single' quotes are known as hard quotes.
"Double" quotes are known as soft quotes.

# Single quotes preserve the literal value of each character:
$ var=hello
$ echo '$var'
$var

# Double quotes preserve the special meaning of characters ($, `, ", \):
$ var=hello
$ echo "$var"
hello

# Use single quote character inside single quotes:
$ echo 'Single quote:' "'" 'example'
Single quote: ' example

# Python's shlex module can generate this syntax for you:
>>> import shlex
>>> print(shlex.quote("Single quote: ' example"))
'Single quote: '"'"' example'
