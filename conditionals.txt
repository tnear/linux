CONDITIONALS

How conditionals operate in shell scripting.

Note: spaces around '[' and ']' are required.

$ cat conditionals.sh      
if [ $1 = $2 ]
then
   echo "$1 equals $2"
elif [ $1 -gt $2 ]
then
   echo "$1 > $2"
elif [ $1 -lt $2 ]
then
   echo "$1 < $2"
else
   echo 'N/A'
fi

$ ./conditionals.sh 2 3
2 < 3
