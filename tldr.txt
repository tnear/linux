find

  Find files or directories under the given directory tree, recursively.

  - Find files by extension:
    find root_path -name '*.ext'

  - Find files matching multiple path/name patterns:
    find root_path -path '**/path/**/*.ext' -or -name '*pattern*'

  - Find directories matching a given name, in case-insensitive mode:
    find root_path -type d -iname '*lib*'
