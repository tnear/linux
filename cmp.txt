CMP

cmp - compare two files byte by byte

# Create two different files:
$ printf 'hello' > a.txt
$ printf 'hey' > b.txt  

# Compare them with cmp:
$ cmp a.txt b.txt    
a.txt b.txt differ: byte 3, line 1

# Compare same file (no different shows no output):
$ cmp a.txt a.txt
<no output for same contents>

# -b, --print-bytes: print differing bytes
$ cmp -b a.txt b.txt
a.txt b.txt differ: byte 3, line 1 is 154 l 171 y
