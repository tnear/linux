CHMOD

chmod - change mode - change file mode bits

# Allow all to read, write, and execute a file:
$ chmod 777 file.txt

# -v = verbose:
$ chmod -v 777 file.txt
mode of 'file.txt' changed from 0644 (rw-r--r--) to 0777 (rwxrwxrwx)

# SYMBOLIC MODES:
# chmod [ugoa][+-=][rwxst]
# u = user, g = group, o = others, a = all
# + is add, - is remove, = is assign
# r = read, w = write, x = execute, s = setuid, t = sticky

# For current user (u), add (+) SUID bit (set user ID bit).
# SUID sets effective user ID for calling process.
# Useful for running as root. "passwd" command works this way.
# When the bit is set, "ls" displays a red background color for the file:
$ chmod u+s file.txt

# 4-digit syntax. First digit controls special bits. SUID=4, Sticky=1:
$ chmod 4777 file.txt

# For user (u) and group (g), add write (r) and execute (x) permissions:
$ chmod ug+rx file.txt

# Add execute permissions to shell scripts:
$ chmod +x script.sh
