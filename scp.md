# SCP

scp â€” OpenSSH secure file copy

## Copy file 'file1.txt' from local to remote machine
```
scp file1.txt user@cs.example.edu:/home/user/path/file1.txt
```

## Copy file 'file1.txt' from remote machine to local
```
scp user@cs.example.edu:/home/user/path/file1.txt file1.txt
```

## -r = recursive copy. Copy directory d and all its contents
```
scp -r /tmp/d user@cs.example.edu:/home/user/d
```

Note: it's often more efficient to [`tar`](tar.md) first then copy the archive.
