# SCP

`scp` â€” OpenSSH secure file copy

See also: [`rsync`](rsync.md)

## Copy `file1.txt` from local to remote machine
```bash
scp file1.txt user@cs.example.edu:/home/user/path/file1.txt
```

## Copy `file1.txt` from remote machine to local

*Note: this must be run in the **local** machine.*
```bash
scp user@cs.example.edu:/home/user/path/file1.txt file1.txt
```

## `-r` = recursive copy. Copy directory `/tmp/d` and all its contents
```bash
scp -r /tmp/d user@cs.example.edu:/home/user/d
```

Note: it's often more efficient to [`tar`](tar.md) a directory first before `scp` (or `rsync`).
