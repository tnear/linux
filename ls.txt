LS

ls - list directory contents

# Common flags:
-a = list all files (including hidden)
-d = list directory itself (instead of directory contents)
-h = human-readable sizes (ex: 977K instead of 1000000)
-i = include inode number (ex: $ ls -li)
-l = long format
-r = reverse output order
-R = recursive search of sub-directories, ex: $ ls -lR
-S = sort by size (largest first)
-t = sort by timestamp, ex: $ ls -ltr shows oldest contents on top

# List all symbolic links in sub-directories of pwd:
$ ls -lR | grep '^l'

# Note: a better way is using 'find':
# find . -type l -ls

# -d = list directory itself. Directories have the letter 'd' at the front:
$ ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt 14 root 4096 /tmp
