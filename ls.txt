LS

ls - list directory contents

# Flags
-a = list all files (including hidden)
-i = include inode number (ex: $ ls -li)
-l = long format
-r = reverse output order
-R = recursive search of sub-driectories, ex: $ ls -lR
-t = sort by timestamp, ex: $ ls -ltr shows oldest contents on top
-d = list directory itself (instead of directory contents)

# List all symbolic links in sub-directories of pwd:
$ ls -lR | grep "^l"

# -d = list directory itself. This has the letter 'd' at the front:
$ ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt 14 root 4096 /tmp
