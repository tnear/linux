# !

Fetch commands from history.

## Return previous command by prefix
Use `!<cmd>` to run the previous usage of that command.
```bash
$ gcc formatString.c -o formatString -g -m32 -Wall
$ !gcc
```

## Reload previous command (!!)
Useful for prefixing the previous command.
```bash
$ apt install ltrace
E: Permission denied, are you root?
$ sudo !!
# success!
```

## Fetch words from previous command
### Fetch last word of previous command
Use `!$` or `!:$` to get the last word of the previous command.
```bash
$ touch long_file_name.txt
$ vi !$
"long_file_name.txt" 0L, 0B
```

### Fetch first word of previous command
Use `!^` or `!:^` to get the first word of a previous command.
```bash
$ echo one two three
$ echo !^
echo one
```

### Fetch Nth word of previous command
Use `!:<num>` to get the Nth word of the previous command.
```bash
$ echo one two three
$ echo !:2
echo two
```

### Fetch all arguments of previous command
Use `!*` or `!:*` to get all arguments.
```bash
$ echo one two three
$ echo !*
one two three
```

## Run command on output of previous command (hack)
Note: this hack **executes** the command a second time.
```bash
$ readlink soft.lnk
/tmp/a.txt

$ vi $(!!)
```

## Run Nth previously executed command: `!-#`
This uses `!-2` to run the 2nd most recent command in the shell's history.
```bash
$ echo abc
$ echo abcd
$ !-2
echo abc
abc
```

## Fetch argument number: `!<cmd>:<num>`
```bash
# !cp:1 => a.txt, !cp:2 => b.txt
$ cp a.txt b.txt
$ echo !cp:2
echo b.txt
b.txt
```

## Run command by number: `!<num>`
```bash
$ history
 5689  cd linux
 5690  echo abc
# Rerun command number:
$ !5690
echo abc
abc
```
