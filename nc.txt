nc - netcat -TCP/IP swiss army knife

Utility which reads and writes data across network connections.
Uses TCP or UDP protocols. Note: executable is 'ncat.exe' on Windows.

stdin is sent to host and stdout is received

Syntax:
$ nc <options> <host> <port>

# Read from host 33.173... and port 9999:
$ nc 33.173.133.43 9999

# Read web page source
# Note: ^M = Ctrl+V + Enter key. This produces carriage return required by HTTP:
$ nc www.google.com 80
GET / HTTP/1.1^M
Host: www.google.com^M
^M

# Alt syntax (without ^M):
$ printf 'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.google.com\r\n\r\n' | nc google.com 80

Copying files:
Note: transferred data is NOT encrypted (unlike with SSH)

# Server command to listen for a file:
$ nc -l -p 1234 > file.txt

-l: listen mode for inbound connects. Often used with -p flag.
-p: port number to receive data
-v: verbose (-vv additional verbosity)
-e: specifies a file name to execute after connect, ex: "-e /bin/bash"
file.txt: file to listen for

Client command to send file to server.
Note how port number and file name are same as above:
$ nc <addr> 1234 < file.txt
