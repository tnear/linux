SSH
ssh â€” 'secure shell' - OpenSSH remote login client

$ ssh username@host

# Simple example:
$ ssh tnear@example.edu

# Common flags:
-X    Enables X11 forwarding
-Y    Enables trusted X11 forwarding (less secure)
-L    Local port forwarding tunnel

# Connect and allow trusted X11 forwarding:
$ ssh -Y tnear@example.edu

# Tell the SSH server at ssh-server.example.com to forward port 8080 on the
# localhost to port 80 on the desired, but restricted, server: social.example.org:
$ ssh -L 8080:social.example.org:80 ssh-server.example.com

^ Allows you to access the restricted server using the url http://localhost:8080/

X11: X Windows System v11

X11 forwarding: an SSH protocol that enables users to run graphical applications

remote machines across wide and heterogeneous server fleets.
